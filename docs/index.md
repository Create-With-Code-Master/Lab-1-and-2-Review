For these assignments you'll review your work on Labs 1 and 2 from Game Design & Programming 1 - revising them as necessary and then submiting two items:

1. For **0.3a** a shared link to the Google Doc for your PDD.
1. For **0.3b** the assignment submission template - if it is complete and you're happy with the score you originally got, you can just resubmit the link. If not, please take the time to update it.

<!-- Pull in repostitory-scope variables from _data/page.yml -->
